      <p>
        Starbucks originally opened in Seattle, Washington, on March 30, 1971.
        By selling high-quality coffee beans and equipments related, Starbucks
        became a local coffee bean retailer for the first ten years in Seattle.
        It was founded by business partners Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl and Gordon
        Bowker who first met as students at the University of San Francisco. The
        trio were inspired to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment by
        coffee roasting entrepreneur Alfred Peet. Bowker recalls that a business
        partner of his, Terry Heckler, thought words beginning with the letters
        "st" were powerful, leading the founders to create a list of words
        beginning with "st", hoping to find a brand name. They chose "Starbo", a
        mining town in the Cascade Range and from there, the group remembered
        "Starbuck", the name of the chief mate in the book Moby-Dick. Bowker
        said, "Moby-Dick didn't have anything to do with Starbucks directly; it
        was only coincidental that the sound seemed to make sense."The first
        Starbucks store was located in Seattle at 2000 Western Avenue from 1971
        to 1976.
